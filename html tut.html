<u><h3>HERE WE GO      HTML5 Semantic Tags</h3>
    <h2>HTML5 introduced several new tags called semantic tags. These tags were designed to communicate the function of blocks of content that were common on many web pages. Prior to HTML5, developers just used <div> tags for all blocks.
    
        Opening Tag	Closing Tag	Description</h2></u>
<P>
    <header>	
            Contains introductory content for a page (e.g., a banner), or a section of a page.
    <br>
    &#8226;(nav)		Contains navigation content, such as a website navigation menu.
    <br>
    &#8226;(main)	/main	Contains the main content of the web page.
    <br>
    &#8226;(aside)		Contains content that is tangentially related to the main content of the page (often this is presented in a sidebar).
    <br>
    &#8226;(footer)		Contains the footer of a page, or of a section of a page. Typically the footer contains information about the content, such as the author and a copyright statement.
    <br>
    &#8226;(Empty) (Non-Container) Tags
    <br>
    Tag	Description
    <br>
    &#8226;(br) 	Line break.

    <br>
    &#8226;(th)		scope="row"
    <br>
    &#8226;(scope="col")	When creating a table to display data, use this tag to differentiate the first row or column of cells as heading cells for all the other cells in the same column or row. Browsers typically display this element bold and centered within the table cell. The scope attribute defines whether this is a row header or column header.
    <br>
    <P>&#8226;(td)		 	Table data cell.</P>
    <p>colspan="number"	Use with (th or td) elements. Spans cells across multiple columns.

 <h5>so there are some tags which dont need ant closing tags so i am here for you to give the names these are listed below:</h5>
 <br>
 <strong><p>these tags dont have to use the closing tags we can write simple in the code editor</p>
 </strong>
 <br>
 <p><em>
    <strong> tag with Description</strong>	
    <br>
    &#8226;(area)	The HTML (area) tag specifies an area within an image map with predetermined clickable zones based on coordinates, which subsequently accepts a URL and behaves as a hyperlink. This element can only be used inside an (map) element.
<br>
&#8226;(base)	The HTML _(base) tag specifies a base URI, often known as a base URL, for relative links in a document. A document can only include one (base) element. For example, you can specify the base URL once in the header area of your page, and all subsequent relative links will utilize that URL as a starting point.
<br>
&#8226;(br)	The HTML _(br) tag is used to create a line break in the text. It is typically employed in poems or addresses where line division is required. It is an empty tag, which means it contains no content and is referred to as a void element. Including the _(br-) tag in the HTML code functions similarly to pressing the enter key in a word processor.
<br>
&#8226;(col)	The HTML _(col) tag specifies the attributes for columns contained within the (colgroup) tag. This allows you to format or add a class to a column or group of columns rather than each individual cell. It is most commonly found within an (colgroup_) element. This element specifies the style property for each column.
<br>
&#8226;(embed)	The HTML _(embed) tag is used to embed external applications, which are typically multimedia elements such as audio or video, at the specified place in an HTML document. It serves as a container for plug-ins such as flash animations. This is a new tag in HTML 5, and it just requires the beginning tag.
<br>
<br>
&#8226;(hr)	The HTML _(hr) tag is used to insert a horizontal rule or a paragraph-level thematic break in a Html document to split or separate document sections. It is used when the topic of your HTML content abruptly changes. It divides them by drawing a horizontal line. The (hr_) tag is an empty tag that does not require a closing tag. For example, a change of scene in a story or a switch of the topic within a segment.
<br>
&#8226;(img)	The HTML _(img) tag is used to display or embed an image on the web page. The HTML image element is an inline and empty element that only includes attributes; closing tags are not used in the image element.
<br>
&#8226;(input)	The HTML _(input) tag is used to create interactive controls for web-based forms to accept data from the user; depending on the device and user agent, a wide variety of input data and control widgets are accessible. The element is among the most powerful and complex in all HTML tags due to the vast amount of input types and attribute combinations. It is used inside the _(form_) element to declare input controls that allow users to enter data. _(label_) can be used to define labels for the input element.
<br>
&#8226;(link)	The HTML _(link) tag is used to establish a connection between a current document and an external resource. The link tag is mainly used to connect to external sheets and establish site icons (both "favicon" style icons and icons for the home screen and apps on mobile devices), among other things. This element can appear more than once, but it only appears in the head section. The link element's values indicate how the item is linked to and is related to the containing page.
<br>
&#8226;(meta)	The HTML _(meta) tag allows you to add metadata - extra essential information about a document in a number of ways. The _(meta_) elements can be used to incorporate name/value pairs specifying HTML document features such as expiry date, author, a list of keywords, document author, etc. You can include more than one meta tag in your document depending on the information you wish to maintain. Still, in general, meta tags do not affect the physical appearance of the document. Thus it makes no difference whether you include them or not.
<br>
&#8226;(param)	The HTML _(param) tag is used to pass a parameter to the object associated with the _(object_) element for plug-ins. We can use several __(param_) tags within an _(object_) element in any order, but each tag must have a name and value attribute and should be inserted at the beginning of the content. The parameter tag governs the behavior of the (object_) element by specifying a distinct pair of name and value attributes, such as autoplay, controller, etc.
<br>
&#8226;(source)	The HTML _(source) tag is used as a child element to define multiple media resources for the (audio), _(video_), and _(image_) elements. It is widely used to provide the same media material in several file formats, such as mp3, mp4, and so on, in order to enable compatibility with a wide range of browsers due to their varying support for image and media file formats. Basically, it is used to attach multimedia assets such as audio, video, and images.
<br>
&#8226;(track)	The HTML _(track) tag is used as a child element of _(audio_) and _(video_) elements in order to define time-based text tracks for a media file.  It is used to include a subtitle, caption, or any other type of text that will be rendered when a media file gets displayed. For example, it allows you to set timed text tracks (or time-based data) to handle subtitles automatically. WebVTT (Web Video Text Tracks) format (.vtt files) is used for the tracks.
<br>
&#8226;(wbr)	The HTML _(wbr) tag  stands for word break opportunity. This tag denotes a spot within the text where the browser may optionally break a line, even though its line-breaking rules would not otherwise cause a break at that location. It is typically used when the employed term is too long, and there is a risk that the browser would break lines at the incorrect location in order to fit the content.

 <strong>BOILERPLATE :- <P><em>Boilerplate is called when a DOCTYPE appers on the screen ,Doctype is the type of file which is DOCUMENT,
    and there is a "title" which shows in tab.
